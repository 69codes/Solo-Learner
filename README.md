One man mopol, i am all by myself
i am here for it all, here for all the bullets i receive. 
HALF-BAKED
I am who i say i am, if i take this literally, i may be doing myself more harm than good. If i claim to be a programmer, am i a programmer immediatley? offcourse not. So the problem 
of naming myself what i am not in the name of claiming it for myself have gone a long way in damaging this glorious industry.
]My desperation for of getting a new job led me into some research, i found out i don't need to know anything, i jsut need to "perfectly pretend",
how is this done? ok, by creating a NICE CV, OUSTANDING COVER LETTER, GREAT LINKDEN PROFILE, AND LASTLY VERY VERY ACTIVE GITHUB ACCOUNT...... So i will put my sweat into creating
a nice profile than the work itself or problem solving. 
THis is a problem but non the less, i dont care. I HAVE TO EAT!!
